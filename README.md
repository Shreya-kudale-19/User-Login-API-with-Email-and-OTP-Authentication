# User-Login-API-with-Email-and-OTP-Authentication

The goal of this project is to develop a secure and efficient API system for user authentication using email and One-Time Password (OTP). This system will enable users to log in by providing their email address, receiving an OTP, and verifying the OTP to gain access.
